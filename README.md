For educational research i am willing to make a Remote Administration tool that can perform plenty of actions.

The main goal for me is to discover network security stacked with Oriented object language like C++.

After i manage to understand the basics of socket programming i instantly had to try adding openssl library to my project.

I learned the basics of asymetric encryption and with the help of openssl documentation i manage to create a class object named "Encryption" that gather all the steps needed to use openssl on our Win sockets.

After that i will implement my class into the socket one and replace the basic winapi sockets functions.
